Hence, `node-fetch`, minimal code for a `window.fetch` compatible API on Node.js runtime.\n\nSee Matt Andrews\' [isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) or Leonardo Quixada\'s [cross-fetch](https://github.com/lquixada/cross-fetch) for isomorphic usage (exports `node-fetch` for server-side, `whatwg-fetch` for client-side).\n\n## Features\n\n- Stay consistent with `window.fetch` API.\n- Make conscious trade-off when following [WHATWG fetch spec][whatwg-fetch] and [stream spec](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/) implementation details, document known differences.\n- Use native promise but allow substituting it with [insert your favorite promise library].\n- Use native Node streams for body on both request and response.\n- Decode content encoding (gzip/deflate) properly and convert string output (such as `res.text()` and `res.json()`) to UTF-8 automatically.\n- Useful extensions such as timeout, redirect limit, response size limit, [explicit errors](ERROR-HANDLING.md) for troubleshooting.\n\n## Difference from client-side fetch\n\n- See [Known Differences](LIMITS.md) for details.\n- If you happen to use a missing feature that `window.fetch` offers, feel free to open an issue.\n- Pull requests are welcomed too!\n\n## Installation\n\nCurrent stable release (`2.x`)\n\n```sh\n$ npm install node-fetch\n```\n\n## Loading and configuring the module\nWe suggest you load the module via `require` until the stabilization of ES modules in node:\n```js\nconst fetch = require(\'node-fetch\');\n```\n\nIf you are using a Promise library other than native, set it through `fetch.Promise`:\n```js\nconst Bluebird = require(\'bluebird\');\n\nfetch.Promise = Bluebird;\n```\n\n## Common Usage\n\nNOTE: The documentation below is up-to-date with `2.x` releases; see the [`1.x` readme](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/1.x/README.md), [changelog](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/1.x/CHANGELOG.md) and [2.x upgrade guide](UPGRADE-GUIDE.md) for the differences.\n\n#### Plain text or HTML\n```js\nfetch(\'https://github.com/\')\n    .then(res => res.text())\n    .then(body => console.log(body));\n```\n\n#### JSON\n\n```js\n\nfetch(\'https://api.github.com/users/github\')\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(json => console.log(json));\n```\n\n#### Simple Post\n```js\nfetch(\'https://httpbin.org/post\', { method: \'POST\', body: \'a=1\' })\n    .then(res => res.json()) // expecting a json response\n    .then(json => console.log(json));\n```\n\n#### Post with JSON\n\n```js\nconst body = { a: 1 };\n\nfetch(\'https://httpbin.org/post\', {\n        method: \'post\',\n        body:    JSON.stringify(body),\n        headers: { \'Content-Type\': \'application/json\' },\n    })\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(json => console.log(json));\n```\n\n#### Post with form parameters\n`URLSearchParams` is available in Node.js as of v7.5.0. See [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_class_urlsearchparams) for more usage methods.\n\nNOTE: The `Content-Type` header is only set automatically to `x-www-form-urlencoded` when an instance of `URLSearchParams` is given as such:\n\n```js\nconst { URLSearchParams } = require(\'url\');\n\nconst params = new URLSearchParams();\nparams.append(\'a\', 1);\n\nfetch(\'https://httpbin.org/post\', { method: \'POST\', body: params })\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(json => console.log(json));\n```\n\n#### Handling exceptions\nNOTE: 3xx-5xx responses are *NOT* exceptions and should be handled in `then()`; see the next section for more information.\n\nAdding a catch to the fetch promise chain will catch *all* exceptions, such as errors originating from node core libraries, network errors and operational errors, which are instances of FetchError. See the [error handling document](ERROR-HANDLING.md)  for more details.\n\n```js\nfetch(\'https://domain.invalid/\')\n    .catch(err => console.error(err));\n```\n\n#### Handling client and server errors\nIt is common to create a helper function to check that the response contains no client (4xx) or server (5xx) error responses:\n\n```js\nfunction checkStatus(res) {\n    if (res.ok) { // res.status >= 200 && res.status < 300\n        return res;\n    } else {\n        throw MyCustomError(res.statusText);\n    }\n}\n\nfetch(\'https://httpbin.org/status/400\')\n    .then(checkStatus)\n    .then(res => console.log(\'will not get here...\'))\n```\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n#### Streams\nThe "Node.js way" is to use streams when possible:\n\n```js\nfetch(\'https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png\')\n    .then(res => {\n        const dest = fs.createWriteStream(\'./octocat.png\');\n        res.body.pipe(dest);\n    });\n```\n\nIn Node.js 14 you can also use async iterators to read `body`; however, be careful to catch\nerrors -- the longer a response runs, the more likely it is to encounter an error.\n\n```js\nconst fetch = require(\'node-fetch\');\nconst response = await fetch(\'https://httpbin.org/stream/3\');\ntry {\n\tfor await (const chunk of response.body) {\n\t\tconsole.dir(JSON.parse(chunk.toString()));\n\t}\n} catch (err) {\n\tconsole.error(err.stack);\n}\n```\n\nIn Node.js 12 you can also use async iterators to read `body`; however, async iterators with streams\ndid not mature until Node.js 14, so you need to do some extra work to ensure you handle errors\ndirectly from the stream and wait on it response to fully close.\n\n```js\nconst fetch = require(\'node-fetch\');\nconst read = async body => {\n    let error;\n    body.on(\'error\', err => {\n        error = err;\n    });\n    for await (const chunk of body) {\n        console.dir(JSON.parse(chunk.toString()));\n    }\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n        body.on(\'close\', () => {\n            error ? reject(error) : resolve();\n        });\n    });\n};\ntry {\n    const response = await fetch(\'https://httpbin.org/stream/3\');\n    await read(response.body);\n} catch (err) {\n    console.error(err.stack);\n}\n```\n\n#### Buffer\nIf you prefer to cache binary data in full, use buffer(). (NOTE: `buffer()` is a `node-fetch`-only API)\n\n```js\nconst fileType = require(\'file-type\');\n\nfetch(\'https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png\')\n    .then(res => res.buffer())\n    .then(buffer => fileType(buffer))\n    .then(type => { /* ... */ });\n```\n\n#### Accessing Headers and other Meta data\n```js\nfetch(\'https://github.com/\')\n    .then(res => {\n        console.log(res.ok);\n        console.log(res.status);\n        console.log(res.statusText);\n        console.log(res.headers.raw());\n        console.log(res.headers.get(\'content-type\'));\n    });\n```\n\n#### Extract Set-Cookie Header\n\nUnlike browsers, you can access raw `Set-Cookie` headers manually using `Headers.raw()`. This is a `node-fetch` only API.\n\n```js\nfetch(url).then(res => {\n    // returns an array of values, instead of a string of comma-separated values\n    console.log(res.headers.raw()[\'set-cookie\']);\n});\n```\n\n#### Post data using a file stream\n\n```js\nconst { createReadStream } = require(\'fs\');\n\nconst stream = createReadStream(\'input.txt\');\n\nfetch(\'https://httpbin.org/post\', { method: \'POST\', body: stream })\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(json => console.log(json));\n```\n\n#### Post with form-data (detect multipart)\n\n```js\nconst FormData = require(\'form-data\');\n\nconst form = new FormData();\nform.append(\'a\', 1);\n\nfetch(\'https://httpbin.org/post\', { method: \'POST\', body: form })\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(json => console.log(json));\n\n// OR, using custom headers\n// NOTE: getHeaders() is non-standard API\n\nconst form = new FormData();\nform.append(\'a\', 1);\n\nconst options = {\n    method: \'POST\',\n    body: form,\n    headers: form.getHeaders()\n}\n\nfetch(\'https://httpbin.org/post\', options)\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(json => console.log(json));\n```\n\n#### Request cancellation with AbortSignal\n\n> NOTE: You may cancel streamed requests only on Node >= v8.0.0\n\nYou may cancel requests with `AbortController`. A suggested implementation is [`abort-controller`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/abort-controller).\n\nAn example of timing out a request after 150ms could be achieved as the following:\n\n```js\nimport AbortController from \'abort-controller\';\n\nconst controller = new AbortController();\nconst timeout = setTimeout(\n  () => { controller.abort(); },\n  150,\n);\n\nfetch(url, { signal: controller.signal })\n  .then(res => res.json())\n  .then(\n    data => {\n      useData(data)\n    },\n    err => {\n      if (err.name === \'AbortError\') {\n        // request was aborted\n      }\n    },\n  )\n  .finally(() => {\n    clearTimeout(timeout);\n  });\n```\n\nSee [test cases](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/master/test/test.js) for more examples.\n\n\n## API\n\n### fetch(url[, options])\n\n- `url` A string representing the URL for fetching\n- `options` [Options](#fetch-options) for the HTTP(S) request\n- Returns: <code>Promise&lt;[Response](#class-response)&gt;</code>\n\nPerform an HTTP(S) fetch.\n\n`url` should be an absolute url, such as `https://example.com/`. A path-relative URL (`/file/under/root`) or protocol-relative URL (`//can-be-http-or-https.com/`) will result in a rejected `Promise`.\n\n<a id="fetch-options"></a>\n### Options\n\nThe default values are shown after each option key.\n\n```js\n{\n    // These properties are part of the Fetch Standard\n    method: \'GET\',\n    headers: {},        // request headers. format is the identical to that accepted by the Headers constructor (see below)\n    body: null,         // request body. can be null, a string, a Buffer, a Blob, or a Node.js Readable stream\n    redirect: \'follow\', // set to `manual` to extract redirect headers, `error` to reject redirect\n    signal: null,       // pass an instance of AbortSignal to optionally abort requests\n\n    // The following properties are node-fetch extensions\n    follow: 20,         // maximum redirect count. 0 to not follow redirect\n    timeout: 0,         // req/res timeout in ms, it resets on redirect. 0 to disable (OS limit applies). Signal is recommended instead.\n    compress: true,     // support gzip/deflate content encoding. false to disable\n    size: 0,            // maximum response body size in bytes. 0 to disable\n    agent: null         // http(s).Agent instance or function that returns an instance (see below)\n}\n```\n\n##### Default Headers\n\nIf no values are set, the following request headers will be sent automatically:\n\nHeader              | Value\n------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------\n`Accept-Encoding`   | `gzip,deflate` _(when `options.compress === true`)_\n`Accept`            | `*/*`\n`Content-Length`    | _(automatically calculated, if possible)_\n`Transfer-Encoding` | `chunked` _(when `req.body` is a stream)_\n`User-Agent`        | `node-fetch/1.0 (+https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch)`\n\nNote: when `body` is a `Stream`, `Content-Length` is not set automatically.\n\n##### Custom Agent\n\nThe `agent` option allows you to specify networking related options which are out of the scope of Fetch, including and not limited to the following:\n\n- Support self-signed certificate\n- Use only IPv4 or IPv6\n- Custom DNS Lookup\n\nSee [`http.Agent`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_new_agent_options) for more information.\n\nIf no agent is specified, the default agent provided by Node.js is used. Note that [this changed in Node.js 19](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/4267b92604ad78584244488e7f7508a690cb80d0/lib/_http_agent.js#L564) to have `keepalive` true by default. If you wish to enable `keepalive` in an earlier version of Node.js, you can override the agent as per the following code sample. \n\nIn addition, the `agent` option accepts a function that returns `http`(s)`.Agent` instance given current [URL](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html), this is useful during a redirection chain across HTTP and HTTPS protocol.\n\n```js\nconst httpAgent = new http.Agent({\n    keepAlive: true\n});\nconst httpsAgent = new https.Agent({\n    keepAlive: true\n});\n\nconst options = {\n    agent: function (_parsedURL) {\n        if (_parsedURL.protocol == \'http:\') {\n            return httpAgent;\n        } else {\n            return httpsAgent;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<a id="class-request"></a>\n### Class: Request\n\nAn HTTP(S) request containing information about URL, method, headers, and the body. This class implements the [Body](#iface-body) interface.\n\nDue to the nature of Node.js, the following properties are not implemented at this moment:\n\n- `type`\n- `destination`\n- `referrer`\n- `referrerPolicy`\n- `mode`\n- `credentials`\n- `cache`\n- `integrity`\n- `keepalive`\n\nThe following node-fetch extension properties are provided:\n\n- `follow`\n- `compress`\n- `counter`\n- `agent`\n\nSee [options](#fetch-options) for exact meaning of these extensions.\n\n#### new Request(input[, options])\n\n<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>\n\n- `input` A string representing a URL, or another `Request` (which will be cloned)\n- `options` [Options][#fetch-options] for the HTTP(S) request\n\nConstructs a new `Request` object. The constructor is identical to that in the [browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/Request).\n\nIn most cases, directly `fetch(url, options)` is simpler than creating a `Request` object.\n\n<a id="class-response"></a>\n### Class: Response\n\nAn HTTP(S) response. This class implements the [Body](#iface-body) interface.\n\nThe following properties are not implemented in node-fetch at this moment:\n\n- `Response.error()`\n- `Response.redirect()`\n- `type`\n- `trailer`\n\n#### new Response([body[, options]])\n\n<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>\n\n- `body` A `String` or [`Readable` stream][node-readable]\n- `options` A [`ResponseInit`][response-init] options dictionary\n\nConstructs a new `Response` object. The constructor is identical to that in the [browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response).\n\nBecause Node.js does not implement service workers (for which this class was designed), one rarely has to construct a `Response` directly.\n\n#### response.ok\n\n<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>\n\nConvenience property representing if the request ended normally. Will evaluate to true if the response status was greater than or equal to 200 but smaller than 300.\n\n#### response.redirected\n\n<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>\n\nConvenience property representing if the request has been redirected at least once. Will evaluate to true if the internal redirect counter is greater than 0.\n\n<a id="class-headers"></a>\n### Class: Headers\n\nThis class allows manipulating and iterating over a set of HTTP headers. All methods specified in the [Fetch Standard][whatwg-fetch] are implemented.\n\n#### new Headers([init])\n\n<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>\n\n- `init` Optional argument to pre-fill the `Headers` object\n\nConstruct a new `Headers` object. `init` can be either `null`, a `Headers` object, an key-value map object or any iterable object.\n\n```js\n// Example adapted from https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#example-headers-class\n\nconst meta = {\n  \'Content-Type\': \'text/xml\',\n  \'Breaking-Bad\': \'<3\'\n};\nconst headers = new Headers(meta);\n\n// The above is equivalent to\nconst meta = [\n  [ \'Content-Type\', \'text/xml\' ],\n  [ \'Breaking-Bad\', \'<3\' ]\n];\nconst headers = new Headers(meta);\n\n// You can in fact use any iterable objects, like a Map or even another Headers\nconst meta = new Map();\nmeta.set(\'Content-Type\', \'text/xml\');\nmeta.set(\'Breaking-Bad\', \'<3\');\nconst headers = new Headers(meta);\nconst copyOfHeaders = new Headers(headers);\n```\n\n<a id="iface-body"></a>\n### Interface: Body\n\n`Body` is an abstract interface with methods that are applicable to both `Request` and `Response` classes.\n\nThe following methods are not yet implemented in node-fetch at this moment:\n\n- `formData()`\n\n#### body.body\n\n<small>*(deviation from spec)*</small>\n\n* Node.js [`Readable` stream][node-readable]\n\nData are encapsulated in the `Body` object. Note that while the [Fetch Standard][whatwg-fetch] requires the property to always be a WHATWG `ReadableStream`, in node-fetch it is a Node.js [`Readable` stream][node-readable].\n\n#### body.bodyUsed\n\n<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>\n\n* `Boolean`\n\nA boolean property for if this body has been consumed. Per the specs, a consumed body cannot be used again.\n\n#### body.arrayBuffer()\n#### body.blob()\n#### body.json()\n#### body.text()\n\n<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>\n\n* Returns: <code>Promise</code>\n\nConsume the body and return a promise that will resolve to one of these formats.\n\n#### body.buffer()\n\n<small>*(node-fetch extension)*</small>\n\n* Returns: <code>Promise&lt;Buffer&gt;</code>\n\nConsume the body and return a promise that will resolve to a Buffer.\n\n#### body.textConverted()\n\n<small>*(node-fetch extension)*</small>\n\n* Returns: <code>Promise&lt;String&gt;</code>\n\nIdentical to `body.text()`, except instead of always converting to UTF-8, encoding sniffing will be performed and text converted to UTF-8 if possible.\n\n(This API requires an optional dependency of the npm package [encoding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/encoding), which you need to install manually. `webpack` users may see [a warning message](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/issues/412#issuecomment-379007792) due to this optional dependency.)\n\n<a id="class-fetcherror"></a>\n### Class: FetchError\n\n<small>*(node-fetch extension)*</small>\n\nAn operational error in the fetching process. See [ERROR-HANDLING.md][] for more info.\n\n<a id="class-aborterror"></a>\n### Class: AbortError\n\n<small>*(node-fetch extension)*</small>\n\nAn Error thrown when the request is aborted in response to an `AbortSignal`\'s `abort` event. It has a `name` property of `AbortError`. See [ERROR-HANDLING.MD][] for more info.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThanks to [github/fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch) for providing a solid implementation reference.\n\n`node-fetch` v1 was maintained by [@bitinn](https://github.com/bitinn); v2 was maintained by [@TimothyGu](https://github.com/timothygu), [@bitinn](https://github.com/bitinn) and [@jimmywarting](https://github.com/jimmywarting); v2 readme is written by [@jkantr](https://github.com/jkantr).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n[npm-image]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/v/node-fetch\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch\n[travis-image]: https://flat.badgen.net/travis/bitinn/node-fetch\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/bitinn/node-fetch\n[codecov-image]: https://flat.badgen.net/codecov/c/github/bitinn/node-fetch/master\n[codecov-url]: https://codecov.io/gh/bitinn/node-fetch\n[install-size-image]: https://flat.badgen.net/packagephobia/install/node-fetch\n[install-size-url]: https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=node-fetch\n[discord-image]: https://img.shields.io/discord/619915844268326952?color=%237289DA&label=Discord&style=flat-square\n[discord-url]: https://discord.gg/Zxbndcm\n[opencollective-image]: https://opencollective.com/node-fetch/backers.svg\n[opencollective-url]: https://opencollective.com/node-fetch\n[whatwg-fetch]: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/\n[response-init]: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#responseinit\n[node-readable]: https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams\n[mdn-headers]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers\n[LIMITS.md]: https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/master/LIMITS.md\n[ERROR-HANDLING.md]: https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/master/ERROR-HANDLING.md\n[UPGRADE-GUIDE.md]: https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/master/UPGRADE-GUIDE.md\n',

ES modules version.\n- [dist/abort-controller.js](dist/abort-controller.js) ... Common JS version.\n- [dist/abort-controller.umd.js](dist/abort-controller.umd.js) ... UMD (Universal Module Definition) version. This is transpiled by [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for IE 11.\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\n### Basic\n\n```js\nimport AbortController from "abort-controller"\n// or\nconst AbortController = require("abort-controller")\n\n// or UMD version defines a global variable:\nconst AbortController = window.AbortControllerShim\n```\n\nIf your bundler recognizes `browser` field of `package.json`, the imported `AbortController` is the native one and it doesn\'t contain shim (even if the native implementation was nothing).\nIf you wanted to polyfill `AbortController` for IE, use `abort-controller/polyfill`.\n\n### Polyfilling\n\nImporting `abort-controller/polyfill` assigns the `AbortController` shim to the `AbortController` global variable if the native implementation was nothing.\n\n```js\nimport "abort-controller/polyfill"\n// or\nrequire("abort-controller/polyfill")\n```\n\n### API\n\n#### AbortController\n\n> https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-abortcontroller\n\n##### controller.signal\n\nThe [AbortSignal](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-AbortSignal) object which is associated to this controller.\n\n##### controller.abort()\n\nNotify `abort` event to listeners that the `signal` has.\n\n## 📰 Changelog\n\n- See [GitHub releases](https://github.com/mysticatea/abort-controller/releases).\n\n## 🍻 Contributing\n\nContributing is welcome ❤️\n\nPlease use GitHub issues/PRs.\n\n### Development tools\n\n- `npm install` installs dependencies for development.\n- `npm test` runs tests and measures code coverage.\n- `npm run clean` removes temporary files of tests.\n- `npm run coverage` opens code coverage of the previous test with your default browser.\n- `npm run lint` runs ESLint.\n- `npm run build` generates `dist` codes.\n- `npm run watch` runs tests on each file change.\n',

If necessary, consider using a polyfill such as [abortcontroller-polyfill].\n\n## Compliance\n\nThe polyfill implements [version `e9355ce` (18 Apr 2022)][spec-snapshot] of the streams specification.\n\nThe polyfill is tested against the same [web platform tests][wpt] that are used by browsers to test their native implementations.\nIt aims to pass all tests, although it allows some exceptions for practical reasons:\n* The default (ES2015) variant passes all of the tests, except for:\n  * The ["bad buffers and views" tests for readable byte streams][wpt-bad-buffers].\n    These tests require the implementation to synchronously transfer the contents of an `ArrayBuffer`, which is not yet possible from JavaScript (although there is a [proposal][proposal-arraybuffer-transfer] to make it possible).\n    The reference implementation "cheats" on these tests [by making a copy instead][ref-impl-transferarraybuffer], but that is unacceptable for the polyfill\'s performance ([#3][issue-3]).\n  * The [test for the prototype of `ReadableStream`\'s async iterator][wpt-async-iterator-prototype].\n    Retrieving the correct `%AsyncIteratorPrototype%` requires using an async generator (`async function* () {}`), which is invalid syntax before ES2018.\n    Instead, the polyfill [creates its own version][stub-async-iterator-prototype] which is functionally equivalent to the real prototype.\n  * The tests [with patched globals][wpt-rs-patched-global] and [with `Object.prototype.then`][wpt-then-interception].\n    These tests are meant for browsers to ensure user-land modifications cannot affect the internal logic of `pipeTo()` and `tee()`. \n    However, it\'s not reasonable or desirable for a user-land polyfill to try and isolate itself completely from using the global `Object`.\n  * Certain `pipeTo()` tests that require synchronous inspection of the stream\'s state  ([1][wpt-pipe-sync-state-1], [2][wpt-pipe-sync-state-2]).\n    Because the polyfill uses the public `getReader()` and `getWriter()` API to implement `pipeTo()`, it can only *asynchronously* observe if and when a stream becomes closed or errored.\n    Therefore, when the readable and the writable end become errored *at the exact same time*, it\'s difficult for the polyfill to observe these state changes in exactly the same order. \n* The ES5 variant passes the same tests as the ES2015 variant, except for various tests about specific characteristics of the constructors, properties and methods.\n  These test failures do not affect the run-time behavior of the polyfill.\n  For example:\n  * The `name` property of down-leveled constructors is incorrect.\n  * The `length` property of down-leveled constructors and methods with optional arguments is incorrect.\n  * Not all properties and methods are correctly marked as non-enumerable.\n  * Down-leveled class methods are not correctly marked as non-constructable.\n\nThe type definitions are compatible with the built-in stream types of TypeScript 3.3 and higher.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to these people for their work on [the original polyfill][creatorrr-polyfill]:\n\n -
